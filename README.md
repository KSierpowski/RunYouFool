## RunYouFool

I wanted to make a very simple game, but addictive.  
Seeing the reactions of my friends who wanted to improve their over and over score after losing the game.  
The basic rule is not to get hit and collect a certain number of bonuses.  


## Core Mechanics

First, the player has to choose which ball to play. Each of them is slightly different from each other not only visually,  
but also in the time and way the bonuses affect them, or the speed of movement.  
Then has to choose diffuculty and start the game.  
The game will end when you collect 15 bonuses (each level has the same amount to collect) and of course you will avoid all falling obstacles.

### Bonuses  
- Yellow Bonus - Falling obstacles doesn't destroy your ball  
- Pink Bonus - Stop or expand clamped walls  
- Blue Bonus - Multiplies ball's speed  
- Red Bonus - Increases the size of the ball (reduces the amount of collected bonuses by 1)
